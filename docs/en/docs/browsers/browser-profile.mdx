Browser profiles allow you to load a custom browser profile during extension development, which can be useful for replicating real-user behavior, settings, extensions, and session data. You can either use the default profile provided by Extension.js or define your own path using the `--profile` flag in the CLI.

## How Does It Work?

You can specify a custom browser profile to load during the browser launch process. Extension.js will hook into the browser's profile directory and load the specified profile, allowing you to test your extension in a real-world environment.

## How to Use Browser Profiles

### Using the Default Profile

By default, **Extension.js** launches a browser with a fresh, clean profile. This ensures there are no session conflicts or unwanted settings during testing.

### Using a Custom Profile

To use a custom browser profile, you can specify the profile path in the `extension.config.js` file or use the `--profile` flag during the development process.

**Example in `extension.config.js`:**

```js
module.exports = {
  browser: {
    chrome: {
      profile: "path/to/custom/profile",
    },
    firefox: {
      profile: "path/to/custom/firefox-profile",
    },
  },
};
```

### CLI Option: Specifying a Custom Profile Path

You can also define a profile path directly in the CLI using the `--profile` flag:

```bash
extension dev --browser=chrome --profile=/path/to/custom/profile
```

In this case, the **Chrome** browser will launch with the specified profile from `/path/to/custom/profile`. This is useful for loading existing profiles with user-specific settings like extensions, bookmarks, or cookies.

## Best Practices

- **Separate Profiles for Different Browsers**: It's a good practice to maintain separate profiles for each browser to ensure clean, isolated testing environments.
- **Real-World Testing**: Use real browser profiles from actual user sessions to test how your extension interacts with real-world data and settings.
- **Automated Testing**: Define and automate the use of custom profiles to run tests in various user environments.
