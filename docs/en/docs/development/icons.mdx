# Icons

Icons are used in various parts of the extension interface, including the toolbar, context menus, and the extension settings. Extension.js ensures that all icons defined in the `manifest.json` file are correctly processed and emitted to the output directory during the build process.

## How Does It Work?

Extension.js performs the following tasks for icon resources:

1. **Emit Icon Files:** The icon files referenced in the `manifest.json` are emitted to the output directory of the compilation, ensuring that any updates to the icon files trigger a recompile.
2. **Support for Various Formats:** Extension.js supports multiple image formats, including `.png`, `.jpg`, and `.svg`.
3. **Handle Theme Icons:** Additional icons, like theme icons, are supported and can be included via the manifest or special folders.

## Icon Support

The following manifest fields are used to declare icons:

| Manifest Field                | File Type Expected    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `action.default_icon`         | .png, .jpg, .svg      |
| `browser_action.default_icon` | .png, .jpg, .svg      |
| `icons`                       | .png, .jpg, .svg      |
| `page_action.default_icon`    | .png, .jpg, .svg      |
| `sidebar_action.default_icon` | .png, .jpg, .svg (\*) |

> **Note:** Support for `.svg` is currently partial in some browsers for `sidebar_action.default_icon`. Review browser compatibility before using SVGs in this context.

## Where Icons Appear in Extensions

Icons can appear in different locations across the browser interface, based on where they're declared in `manifest.json`:

- **Toolbar Icons:** The `action.default_icon` or `browser_action.default_icon` fields add an icon in the browser's toolbar, making it visible next to the address bar for user interaction.
- **Context Menus:** Declaring icons in `page_action.default_icon` provides a unique icon specific to certain pages, visible only when defined pages are active.
- **Settings and Extensions Menu:** Icons defined under the `icons` field are used in browser settings or the extension management interface. These icons represent the extension and are usually visible within the browser's extension settings page.
- **Side Panel Icons:** The `sidebar_action.default_icon` icon appears within the side panel of supported browsers, such as Firefox, when the extension opens a custom sidebar interface.

## Sample Icon Declaration in `manifest.json`

Below is a basic example of how to declare icons in your `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon-16.png",
    "48": "icons/icon-48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon-128.png"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_icon": "icons/action-icon.png"
  }
}
```

## Using Icons in HTML

When referencing icons in HTML files, icons will be available in the `dist` folder after building and within a folder based on the feature type. If you want to prevent this behavior, you can use the `public` folder to store icons and other assets.

### Sample HTML File using an icon imported from `public` folder

Assume the following project structure:

```plaintext
public/
└── icons/
    ├── icon-48.png
    └── icon-128.png
```

Add the following code to your HTML file to reference the icon:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>My Extension</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="/icons/icon-48.png" alt="Extension Icon" />
    <script src="scripts/content.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Sample HTML File using an icon imported from any other folder

Assume the following project structure:

```plaintext
src/
├── newtab-page.html
└── icons/
    ├── icon-48.png
    └── icon-128.png
```

Add the following code to your HTML file to reference the icon:

```html
<!-- src/newtab-page.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>My Extension</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="./icons/icon-48.png" alt="Extension Icon" />
    <script src="scripts/content.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The output path for icons will be as follows:

```plaintext
dist/
  [browser]
    └── newtab/
        ├── index.html
        └── icon-128.png
```

## Using Icons in JavaScript

You can import icons in JavaScript files using either the `import` syntax or by referencing the icon path directly via the `chrome.runtime.getURL` method.

### Sample JavaScript File using an icon imported from

Assume the following project structure:

```plaintext
src/
├── scripts/
│   └── content.js
└── icons/
    ├── icon-48.png
    └── icon-128.png
```

Add the following code to your JavaScript file to reference the icon:

```javascript
// src/scripts/content.js
import icon48 from "../icons/icon-48.png";

const img = document.createElement("img");
img.src = icon48;
document.body.appendChild(img);
```

## Output Path

The output path for icons follows a structure based on their declared manifest fields. After building, icons are located within the `dist/[browser]/` directory, organized as follows:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon-16.png",
    "48": "icons/icon-48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon-128.png"
  },
  "action": {
    "default_icon": "action/icon-16.png"
  }
}
```

```plaintext
dist/
├── [browser]/
│   ├── action/
│   │   └── icon-16.png
│   ├── icons/
│   │   ├── icon-16.png
│   │   ├── icon-48.png
│   │   ├── icon-128.png
│   │   └── action-icon.png
└── other-extension-files
```

## Best Practices

- **Organize with `/public/` Folder:** Place additional icons not declared in the manifest within the `/public` folder to keep project structure clear and ensure they're accessible if needed.
- **Declare Icons in `manifest.json`:** Always declare icons in the manifest file to ensure they're correctly bundled in the build process.
- **Provide Multiple Resolutions:** Offer icons in multiple resolutions (e.g., `16px`, `48px`, `128px`) to support various device pixel ratios, ensuring icons display clearly on all devices.

## Next Steps

- For handling icons and other assets, learn more about [Special Folders](../features/special-folders.mdx).
- Review Extension.js's [Documentation on Web-Accessible Resources](../development/web-accessible-resources) for additional guidance on managing accessible assets.
