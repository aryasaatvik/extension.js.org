# CSS

Extension.js ensures that CSS files defined in the `manifest.json` or included in HTML files are properly processed, supporting popular pre-processors like Sass, Less, and standard CSS. These styles can be used in both `content_scripts` and HTML pages with their original extensions, making development flexible and modern.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Add CSS Entries:** CSS entries from the manifest and additional styles from HTML or `/styles` folder are added to the compilation.
2. **Inject Styles for Content Scripts:** During development, CSS files are dynamically injected into `content_scripts` to benefit from HMR.
3. **Enable HMR for CSS:** HMR is enabled for CSS files across all relevant extension contexts.
4. **Support for Pre-processors:** Files with `.scss`, `.sass`, and `.less` extensions are fully supported and compiled during the build process.
5. **Support for PostCSS:** PostCSS is supported for additional transformations and optimizations on CSS files.

## CSS Support

The following manifest fields are supported for CSS files:

| Manifest Field        | File Type Expected        | HMR Support |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `content_scripts.css` | .css, .scss, .sass, .less | Yes         |

## Sample CSS in `manifest.json`

Here's a basic example of adding CSS files to `content_scripts` in the `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "css": ["./styles/content-style.less"],
      "js": ["./scripts/content-script.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Sample CSS in HTML Files

CSS can be directly imported in HTML files, with full support for pre-processors like Less and Sass. Simply include the styles with their original extensions, and Extension.js will handle the compilation and injection of these styles:

### Sample HTML File using Sass

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Extension Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/popup-style.sass" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Extension</h1>
    <p>This is a sample extension page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Sample script File using Less

```js
import "./styles/content.less";

console.log("Content script loaded");
```

## Output Path

The output path for CSS files follows the same logic as scripts or HTML. The CSS will be bundled into `[feature]/index.css` for styles imported in HTML files, based on where it's used. For example, for a `newtab` override, the resulting files would look like this:

```plaintext
chrome_url_overrides/
├── index.html
├── index.js
└── index.css
```

For the CSS that represents content scripts in the `manifest.json` file, the output path will be:

```plaintext
content_scripts/
├── index.js
└── index.css
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure your manifest fields correctly reference CSS files to take advantage of live-reloading and asset handling.
- Leverage the power of CSS pre-processors like Sass and Less for more organized and maintainable styles.
