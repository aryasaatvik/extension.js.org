# JSON

JSON in browser extensions provide data for rulesets, managed storage schemas, and more. Extension.js handles the inclusion, bundling, and processing of JSON files referenced in the `manifest.json`, ensuring they are correctly emitted and added to the compilation output.

## How Does It Work?

Extension.js performs the following tasks for JSON resources:

1. **Emit JSON Files:** The JSON files referenced in the `manifest.json` are emitted to the output directory.
2. **Add to File Dependencies:** JSON files are added to the file dependencies of the compilation, ensuring that any updates to the JSON files trigger a recompile.
3. **Error Handling:** If a referenced JSON file is missing or incorrectly configured, warnings are generated to help developers fix issues during the build process.

## JSON Support

The following manifest fields are used to declare JSON files:

| Manifest Field                           | File Type Expected |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `declarative_net_request.rule_resources` | .json              |
| `storage.managed_schema`                 | .json              |

## Sample JSON Declaration in `manifest.json`

Here's an example of how to declare a JSON file in your `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "declarative_net_request": {
    "rule_resources": [
      {
        "id": "ruleset_1",
        "enabled": true,
        "path": "rules/ruleset.json"
      }
    ]
  },
  "storage": {
    "managed_schema": "schema/storage-schema.json"
  }
}
```

This configuration ensures that Extension.js will process the JSON files and include them in the final output of your extension.

## Output Path

The output path for JSON files follows a simple structure based on their context in the manifest. For example, the resulting files would look like this:

```plaintext
dist/
  [browser]/
  ├── declarative_net_request/
  │   └── rule_resources-0.json
  ├── storage/
  │   └── managed_schema.json
  └── other-extension-files
```

## Best Practices

- Use the `/public/` folder for additional JSON files that are not directly declared in the manifest.
- Ensure that JSON files are well-formed and follow the correct schema for their intended use (e.g., rulesets, managed schemas).
