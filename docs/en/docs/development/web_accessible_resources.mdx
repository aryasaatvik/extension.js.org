# Web Accessible Resources

Web-accessible resources are files within an extension that can be accessed by web pages or other extensions.
These resources are often used for images, scripts, or stylesheets that are required by content scripts or
pages embedded within an extension's context.

## How It Works?

Extension.js performs the following tasks for web-accessible resources:

1. **Generate Manifest Patches:** Updates the `manifest.json` file with paths for web-accessible resources
   based on the content scripts and assets being used.
2. **Add Resources to Compilation:** Assets used in content scripts or referenced in the manifest are added
   to the compilation process.
3. **Emit Assets:** All assets declared as web-accessible are emitted to the output directory.
4. **Support for Multiple Asset Types:** Various file types, including images, scripts, and stylesheets,
   are supported.
5. **Error Handling:** Checks for missing assets and issues warnings if resources declared in the manifest
   are not found during the build process.

## Web Accessible Resources Support

The following manifest field is used to declare web-accessible resources:

| Manifest Field             | File Type Expected | HMR Support |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| `web_accessible_resources` | Any file type      | No          |

## Sample `manifest.json` File

If the resources you need to declare are already imported by the content scripts, you don't need to declare
them in the `web_accessible_resources` field. For all other cases, you can declare the resources in the `manifest.json` file.

### Manifest V3

Here's an example of how to declare web-accessible resources in the `manifest.json` file for manifest V3.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": ["images/*.png", "scripts/*.js", "styles/*.css"],
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
    }
  ],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://example.com/*"],
      "css": ["styles/content.css"],
      "js": ["scripts/content.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Manifest V2

Here's an example of how to declare web-accessible resources in the `manifest.json` file for manifest V2.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "web_accessible_resources": ["images/*.png", "scripts/*.js", "styles/*.css"],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["https://example.com/*"],
      "css": ["styles/content.css"],
      "js": ["scripts/content.js"]
    }
  ]
}
```

In the examples above, the `web_accessible_resources` field exposes specific resources (images, scripts, styles)
for web pages that match the pattern defined in `matches`.

## Output Path

For a resource to be web-accessible, it must be emitted to the output directory. The easiest way to achieve this
is to place the resources in the `/public` folder. Assets declared in there will be automatically copied to the
output directory during the build process and will be accessible from the root of the extension.

### Example with public folder

```plaintext
/public
  /images
    icon.png
  /scripts
    content.js
  /styles
    content.css
```

In the example above, the `icon.png`, `content.js`, and `content.css` files are web-accessible resources that can
be accessed by web pages or other extensions, so the way they should be declared in the `web_accessible_resources`
field would be:

#### For Manifest V3

```json
{
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": [
        "images/icon.png",
        "scripts/content.js",
        "styles/content.css"
      ],
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### For Manifest V2

```json
{
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    "images/icon.png",
    "scripts/content.js",
    "styles/content.css"
  ]
}
```

For resources not declared in the `web_accessible_resources` field, you can predict their path by examining the
`/dist` folder after building the extension. The resources will be placed in the root of the output directory.
To reference them in your code, you can use the `chrome.runtime.getURL` method.

### Example with `dist/` folder

```plaintext
/dist
  /pages
    my-page.html
  /sandbox
    page-0.html
  manifest.json
```

In the example above, the `my-page.html` and `page-0.html` files are web-accessible resources that can be accessed
by web pages or other extensions, so the way they should be declared in the `web_accessible_resources` field would be:

#### For Manifest V3

```json
{
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": ["pages/my-page.html", "sandbox/page-0.html"],
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Best Practices

- Always declare resources in `web_accessible_resources` if they are intended to be accessible by web pages or
  other external scripts.
- Place additional resources that need to be web-accessible in the `/public` folder to keep your `manifest.json`
  clean and organized.
- Ensure your content scripts correctly reference these assets, especially when working with external web pages.
