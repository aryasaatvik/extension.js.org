# Locales

Locales allow browser extensions to support multiple languages and enhancing the user experience. Extension.js handles locales defined in your manifest.json as the browser would, and ensures that they are emitted and included in the output directory, making them accessible during runtime.

## How Does It Work?

Extension.js performs the following tasks for locale files in Extension.js:

1. **Emit Locale Files:** Locale files declared in the `manifest.json` are emitted to the output directory.
2. **Add to File Dependencies:** Locale files are added to the file dependencies of the compilation, ensuring any updates trigger a rebuild.
3. **Support for Multiple Languages:** Support for multiple languages through the `_locales` folder is provided.
4. **Error Handling:** Warnings are generated if locale files are missing or incorrectly configured during the build process.

## Locales File Support

Extension.js offers robust support for locales, ensuring that all defined translations are correctly emitted and watched for changes. The following manifest fields are used for declaring locales:

| Manifest Field    | File Type Expected | Reload      |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| `default_locale`  | .json              | Live-reload |
| `_locales/*.json` | .json              | Live-reload |

## Sample Locales Declaration in `manifest.json`

Here's how to declare locales in your `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "My Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "default_locale": "en",
  "description": "__MSG_extension_description__"
}
```

You would then include JSON files for each locale inside the `_locales` folder:

```plaintext
_locales/
└── en/
    └── messages.json
```

## Sample `messages.json` File

Here's an example of a `messages.json` file used for translations:

```json
{
  "extension_name": {
    "message": "My Extension"
  },
  "extension_description": {
    "message": "This is a localized description of my extension."
  }
}
```

## Output Path

The output path for locale files will follow the structure defined by the `_locales` folder. The resulting files will look like this:

```plaintext
dist/
└── _locales/
    ├── en/
    │   └── messages.json
    └── fr/
        └── messages.json
```

## Best Practices

- Use the `_locales` folder to organize translations for different languages.
- Always declare your `default_locale` in the `manifest.json` to ensure proper localization support.
- Ensure that your locale JSON files are well-formed and contain all necessary translations.
